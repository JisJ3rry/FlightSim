<p>This repository hosts an Android app which lets you generate a random number.<br>
It is meant for schools, to quickly pick a student randomly.</p>

### How does it work?
<p>The app lets you create a "class", in which you can put the number of students present in mentioned class.<br>
  After selecting the class, the app generates a random integer between 1 and the number of students in the selected class.</p>
